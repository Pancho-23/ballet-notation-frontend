Navigation Between Aspects

The UI will enforce the Step Aspect as first input, you can write on the input 
and then with ENTER key you can navigate to the next ASPECT in order of 
importance, changing the block (using the left of right arrows) will reset the cursor again
to the Step Aspect on the current block. After entering all aspects, another ENTER will 
automatically advance one block (if the phrase allows it, that is, if the current block is not the last one on the phrase).
