Things Learned

1) To render a string with jumps in JSX line it must be done by rendering an array and <br /> or a div or a span.

2) To modify a dynamic object in React must be done INMUTABLY: first const updateObject = {...Object}
Modify updateObject properties normally, then setObject(updateObject)

3) Literals preserve spaces and jumps in line WHEN READ AS TEXT (not when do as HTML or JSX).

4) Use the useEffect with dependecies when a dynamic value depends on others. Include all dependencies.

5) In defining a dynamic array identify objects inside with unique keys.

6) setFunction of useState accept the prevObject as an argument setObject(prevObject => {
  //Code and modify the prevObject to get modifiedObject
  return modifiedObject;
})
