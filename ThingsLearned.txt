Things Learned

1) To render a string with jumps in JSX line it must be done by rendering an array and <br /> or a div or a span.

2) To modify a dynamic object in React must be done INMUTABLY: first const updateObject = {...Object}
Modify updateObject properties normally, then setObject(updateObject)

3) Literals preserve spaces and jumps in line WHEN READ AS TEXT (not when do as HTML or JSX). You have to use 
the <pre></pre> to surround it. Dont forget to take of the margin and padding of the pre element in the css.

4) Use the useEffect with dependecies when a dynamic value depends on others. Include all dependencies.

5) In defining a dynamic array identify objects inside with unique keys.

6) setFunction of useState accept the prevObject as an argument setObject(prevObject => {
  //Code and modify the prevObject to get modifiedObject
  return modifiedObject;
})

7) [\s\S]* is the regex for anycharacter INCLUDING newlines and tabs.
